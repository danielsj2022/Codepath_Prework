An app I would like to build is a gym app. The capabilities would be taking a weight and saying what pound plates to put on each side of the bar. Users can record maxes for different workouts. They can also find a rep breakdown of how much weight they should do for how many reps based on their max.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
